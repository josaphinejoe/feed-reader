# Project Overview


Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!


## What will I learn?

I learned how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These will test the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.


## How will this help my career?

* Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.
* Good tests give me the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within our codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.


#  Technologies Used

- Jasmine
- jQuery
- HTML5/CSS3


## How to run

* Choose any browsers as you wish and open the 'index.html'.
* Some additional network requests are made.
* So, it take some time to load completely.
* The test results are displayed at the bottom of the page, once it is loaded.
